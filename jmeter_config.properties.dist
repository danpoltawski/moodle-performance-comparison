# You can use these vars to specify what difference between runs
# can be considered an increase or a decrease and what can
# be ignored. The number represents a percentage between the first
# run and the other/s one/s.

# different vars of a run when comparing each of the test plan
# steps. Default value as defined in defaults.properties:

# This var value will mark the accepted difference between the
# different vars of a run when comparing the sum of all test
# plan steps. Default value as defined in defaults.properties:
#
# singlestepthreshold=2
#
# You can also specify a JSON associative array with the detailed list of thresholds which will
# have preference over $groupedthreshold and $singlestepthreshold. The JSON string should be defined
# all in one line, wrapped using single quotes, and following this format:
#
# thresholds='{"bystep":{"dbreads":2,"dbwrites":2,"memoryused":2,"filesincluded":1,"serverload":10,"sessionsize":2,"timeused":5},"total":{"dbreads":2,"dbwrites":2,"memoryused":2,"filesincluded":1,"serverload":10,"sessionsize":2,"timeused":5}}'
#
# Include logs table writes as db writes, this is enabled by default.
# Set includelogs="" in case you don't want to include them.
#
# includelogs=1
